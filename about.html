				<p>   Kathy went to school in Boone and graduated with the class of ‘89. She began working at a local church daycare and began college classes at the community college for secretarial/clerical classes. She found that teaching in a daycare made her happy and she loved the children. </p>
				<p>    Soon she met her future husband, Michael (the poor dear), and after some time, decided to move to Des Moines to live with him. She found a daycare job that she really liked, and sometimes even did phone work for extra while Michael attended College. Things were going very well, and after Michael’s graduation, they moved to Tampa, Florida, where they lived for 7 years. Kathy once again found a daycare and worked there the whole time, even adding college certifications for childcare to her skills.</p>
                <p>   It soon became obvious that being so far away from family was taking its toll on them, and they decided to move back north in 2001, where they ended up in Chillicothe, where they still are today! 
                    After many years in childcare, the pay in a small town wasn’t really enough, so she began working at a Cold- Storage facility in their supply room, and she was in charge of making sure the temp employees got in and out correctly. She would say, “its still the same as day care, just bigger kids”.

        <h3>An Interview with Kathy Tracy</h3>
       
				<h3>Question 1: What is your favorite book and why?</h3>
                <p>Kathy: Memoirs of a Geisha, I like the book because it really takes you into the life of a Geisha back then, and how they lived. It was very informative and interesting. It was hard to put the book down!</p>

                <h3>Question 2: If you could do any job on earth, what would you pick?</h3>
                <p>Kathy: I actually wish I could be an archeologist. It would be fun to go dig up dinosaurs and treasures. It’s why I like the “National Treasure” movies! Id love to travel all over the world too. </p>
                <h3>Question 3: Is there anything in your past you would change if you could?</h3>
                <p>Kathy: I would change how I reacted to bullies in High School. I had Scoliosis, and I got picked on a lot. I should have been more defiant. When I stood up for myself, it worked much better. </p>
                <h3>Question 4: If you could only have a cat or a dog, which would you pick and why?</h3>
                <p>Kathy: I would actually rather have a cat, because they are quiet, and easier to care for. They can walk themselves (actually they prefer to), and they really convey emotions so well.  That doesn’t mean I wouldn’t love on every doggo I see!</p>
                <h3>Question 5: What are you the proudest of yourself for?</h3>
                <p>Kathy: I am most proud of making a difference with kids. When I see them later in life and they’ve succeeded, and they cant wait to tell me all about their life, it really makes me feel wonderful, for them and for me!</p>
                <h3>Question 6: If you could have any superpower, what would you choose?</h3>
                <p>Kathy: Super Strength! I’m only 4’9, I need all the strength I can get! They say dynamite comes in small packages. </p>
                <h3>Question 7: If you could go anywhere, what would you like to go see first?</h3>
                <p>Kathy: The Pyramids of Egypt! Their technology and art, as well as their writing skills for their time was really amazing, and they’re so detailed, and mysterious! </p>
                <h3>Question 8: Is there anything about yourself you would like to improve on?</h3>
                <p>Kathy: Yea, I need to get a green thumb, plants shudder in terror at my gardening skills. I would also like to learn to cook better, I haven’t quite mastered what spices go with what best. Either of these would be good things to work on!</p>
                <h3>Question 9: What kind of songs get stuck in your head most? </h3>
                <p>Kathy: I like all kinds of music! Right now, “Elvira” has been stuck in my head for a week! We have a little game I share with my husband and my coworkers where I try to get songs stuck in their heads, but sometimes it backfires. </p>
                <h3>Question 10: Is there any advice you’d like to give to others?</h3>
                <p>Kathy: Life is too short, spend it happily! Say good morning to everyone! Like Nightbirde once said, “You can’t wait until life isn’t hard anymore before you decide to be happy.”</p>
