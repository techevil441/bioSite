          <h3>Who is Kathy Tracy?</h3>
          <p>    Kathy Tracy was born in 1971 to Walter and Joann Shuey. She grew up in Boone, Iowa with her younger sister Carol, in a very close -knit family. They did almost everything together, and rarely spent time apart.  Carol and Kathy were typical siblings, sometimes fighting, sometimes defending each other, and sharing adventures on their bikes. </p>
          <p>Today, Kathy is Married to Michael Tracy, and she still keeps close with her family, helping take care of her mother and father, and spending time with her sister and her children. She works at a cold storage plant, and stays very active.</p>

          <h3>Kathy's Past</h3>
          <p>    Kathyâ€™s Father worked at the Archway Cookie plant, and also was a cook in the military. He often brought his work home with him, much to the happiness of the girls and the squirrels in the neighborhood. He was very outgoing and friendly to everyone.</p>
          <p>    Mom was, for the most part, a stay-at-home mom, and Kathy would describe her as Stubborn, but She always knew what she wanted. She picked up many habits from her, such as reading, and interest in the family history, as well as the goings on in the neighborhood.</p>
